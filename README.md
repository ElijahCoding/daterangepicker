# DatePicker

I was tasked to create a date range picker that mirrored the behavoir found in the Google Analytics date range picker. 

I googled that task and discovered this [stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1971208/looking-for-a-good-date-range-picker-any-suggestions). 

I started with [Justin Stern](http://foxrunsoftware.github.com/DatePicker/) as my base since I knew I could fairly easily port it to Angular or Backbone. 

I didn't want a exact copy but to steal some ideas and also leverage momentjs to build custom ranges which [Dan Grossman](http://www.dangrossman.info/2012/08/20/a-date-range-picker-for-twitter-bootstrap/) did in this example.

## DEMO

Update: I guess I didn't google hard enough because I googled again to see if I had missed anything and sure enough someone else had went down the same rabbit hole solved the problem copying Google's design [more precisely](https://github.com/petrkotek/DatePicker).

In my case, I didn't need an exact copy and I'm fine with doing some digging and know how to update the code base is more valuable anyways. So by all means steal from this and make it your own.
